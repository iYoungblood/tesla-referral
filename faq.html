                <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

                <h2>What is the point of this website?</h2>
                <p>To allow people to share their referral code. As of 12/23 the referral has value for both the buyer and the referrer.</p>

                <h2>Why did you create this?</h2>
                <p>When I was shopping for a Tesla I came across a reddit post on someone who created one and there were questions around how fair it was and would they open source. It was crickets. So I created this and open sourced it and made it as fair as possible. More of this below.</p>

                <h2>How often is this site updated?</h2>
                <p>Randomly.</p>

                <h2>Is this open sourced so we know there is nothing funny going on?</h2>
                <p>The code is opensourced here for full visibility. https://github.com/iYoungblood/tesla-referral </p>

                <h2>How do we know this is fair for everyone?</h2>
                <p>Its as fair as it gets.* Without opening up the database and showing it to everyone, it does a random on the data and returns one of the entries each time you click the button. If you know of a better way to show this data, please let me know.</p>
                
                <h2>What is the * above for?</h2>
                <p>For every 1000 entires, I will add my link again. Why you ask? This domain cost money, the instance costs money... everything costs money, including my time to do this. For up to 1000 links, we are all 1 out of 1000. If there were 5000, I would have an advantage over any other one person as I would be in there 5/5000 entires while others are 1/5000. However, the fairness is that 4995/5000 are not me.</p>
